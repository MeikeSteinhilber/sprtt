SPRT null alternative hypotheses defined follows, 𝜃 representing model parameter : $$ H_0:\\ 𝜃\\ =\\ 𝜃_0 \\\\ H_1:\\ 𝜃\\ =\\ 𝜃_1 $$ test statistic SPRT based likelihood ratio, measure relative evidence data given hypotheses. specifically, ratio likelihood alternative hypothesis likelihood null hypothesis m-th step sampling process (LRm). LRm=f(datam|H1)f(datam|H0)=𝑓(x1,...,xm|𝜃1)𝑓(x1,...,xm|𝜃0) LR_{m}  = \\frac {f(data_m | H_1)} {f(data_m | H_0)} = \\frac {𝑓(x_1,...,x_m | 𝜃_1)} {𝑓(x_1,...,x_m  | 𝜃_0)} transformation t-statistic, model parameter 𝜃 contains parameters normal distribution: mean (µ) standard deviation (𝜎). Therefore, Wald SPRT requires prior knowledge variance (𝜎2) specification hypotheses. transformation observed values associated t-statistic, model parameter 𝜃 contains parameters non-central t-distribution: degrees freedom (df) non-centrality parameter (𝛥). 𝑓(x1,...,xm|µ,𝜎)=>𝑓(t2,...,tm|df,𝛥) {𝑓(x_1,...,x_m | µ,𝜎)} => {𝑓(t_2,...,t_m  | df,𝛥)} calculation degrees freedom, sample size group(s) needed. non-centrality parameter also requires specification expected effect size form Cohen`s d (d). eventually calculate LR sequential t-test, current tm-statistic necessary. Rushton (1950) demonstrated SPRT can performed simply considering ratio probability densities recent tm statistic alternative null hypothesis m-th stage. Thus, test statistic one two-sided sequential t-test can calculated follows: $$ LR_{m,\\ one-sided\\ sequential\\ t-test} = \\frac {𝑓(t_m | 𝜃_1)} {𝑓(t_m | 𝜃_0)} \\\\ LR_{m,\\ two-sided\\ sequential\\ t-test} = \\frac {𝑓(t_m^2 | 𝜃_1)} {𝑓(t_m^2 | 𝜃_0)}. $$ account fact algebraic sign unknown two-sided test, t-value squared (rushton1952?). calculation test statistic, decision either continue sampling terminate sampling accept one hypotheses. . Wald (1945) defined following rules SPRT: B boundaries calculated previously defined error rates 𝛼 (Type error) 𝛽 (Type II error) follows: $$ = \\left( \\frac{1 - 𝛽}{𝛼} \\right) \\\\ B = \\left( \\frac{𝛽}{1 - 𝛼} \\right). $$ summary, three specifications required calculate sequential t-test: 𝛼 error probability (usually 0.05 less), 𝛽 error probability (usually .20 less), Cohen´s d (either expected effect size lower limit substantial effect).","code":""},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://meikesteinhilber.github.io/sprtt/articles/usage_sprtt.html","id":"note","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Note","title":"How to use the sprtt package","text":"data sets used included sprtt package.
