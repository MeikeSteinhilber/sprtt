## What is the sequential one-way ANOVA?

The sequential one-way fixed effects ANOVA is based on the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) by Abraham @wald1947, which is a highly efficient sequential hypothesis test.
It can be used instead of *t*-tests if the means of two or more groups are compared.
For detailed information see the public preprint [@steinhilber2023a].
