The `sprtt` package is a toolbox for **s**equential **p**robability **r**atio **t**ests (SPRTs).
This vignette introduces the core functions and demonstrates a typical analysis workflow.
For more comprehensive guides on specific topics, see the other package vignettes.
If you are unfamiliar with SPRTs, please see the *XXX* section first.


::: {.custom-info-box}

-   The data sets used below are included in the `sprtt` package.
The data sets are available when the package is loaded.

-   In the R code sections:

    -   `# comment`: is a comment
    -   `function()`: is R code
    -   `#> results of function()`: is console output

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the theoretical background of SPRTs

The foundational literature [@wald1945; @wald1947; @rushton1950; @rushton1952; @hajnal1961] offers valuable depth but is not required reading.
However, understanding SPRT mechanics, robustness to assumption violations, and proper application is essential.
The following papers provide a good background:

**Key references:**

- sequential *t*-tests: [@schnuerch2019] <doi:10.1037/met0000234>
- sequential one-way ANOVA: [@steinhilber2024] <doi:10.1037/met0000677>
- understanding questionable research practices in the context of SPRTs: [@steinhilber2025] <doi:10.31234/osf.io/vkbu3_v1>

For comparisons of different sequential designs (including SPRTs), see:

- Group sequential designs vs Sequential Bayes Factor Test vs SPRT [@schnuerch2019] <doi:10.1037/met0000234>
- Sequential Bayes Factor Test vs SPRT [@stefan2022] <doi:10.3758/s13428-021-01754-8>

### 2. Check if SPRTs are the fitting choice

Whether a statistical tool is appropriate depends strongly on the research context and intended use.
SPRTs are recommended when:

- Data can be collected sequentially
- Data can be analyzed sequentially (ideally after each new observation)
- The research question translates to a clear hypothesis test: $H_0$ vs $H_1$ (is there an effect or not?)
- Resources are limited and efficiency is a priority
- Long-term error rates need to be controlled (both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ error rates)
- Accepting $H_0$ (no effect) is of interest

SPRTs are **not** recommended when:

- Sufficient literature already establishes the existence of the effect and the main goal is precise effect size estimation
- Multiple hypotheses must be tested on the same dataset (theoretically possible but not yet implemented)
- Data are collected all at once or only in very large batches
- Groups cannot be sampled somewhat equally over time (e.g., collecting all participants from one group before starting the other)


### 3. Plan your resources

<!-- The `plan_sample_size()` helps you to get realistic expectations of how much data is usually required and how much data you want to collect in the worst case. -->
<!-- For SPRTs a classical a priori power analysis is not necessary as the power ($1-\beta$) is controlled via the stopping boundaries, thus one can just specify the test and immediately start collecting the data and stop if the test reached a decision to accept one of the two hypothesis. -->
<!-- However, it is relevant to plan the necessary resources even if the final sample size is unknown. -->
<!-- Two sample sizes are here of interest: -->

<!-- - the expected sample size ($N_{\text{median}}$): this is the median sample size that is required to reach a decision and usually your final sample size will be close to that number. -->
<!-- - the maximum sample size ($N_{\text{max}}$): this is the maximal sample size that one can afford and it is recommended to choose a setting where $N_{\text{max}}$ leads to a decsion rate of 20% and higher on average. -->

<!-- For more details see the vignette *XXX*. -->

The `plan_sample_size()` function helps establish realistic expectations for data requirements and resource planning.

Unlike traditional designs, SPRTs do not require classical a priori power analysis because power ($1-\beta$) is controlled through the stopping boundaries.
This allows starting data collection immediately and stopping once the test reaches a decision.
However, planning necessary resources remains important for practical concerns.

Two sample sizes are relevant:

- **Expected sample size** ($N_{\text{median}}$): The median sample size required to reach a decision. Most studies will finish near this value.
- **Maximum sample size** ($N_{\text{max}}$): The maximum affordable sample size. Choose settings where $N_{\text{max}}$ yields a decision rate of at least 80% (i.e., the test reaches a decision in at least 80% of cases where the maximum sample is reached).

For more details see the vignette *XXX*.


### 4. Plan the data collection and register your test specifications

A thoughtful data collection plan is highly recommended to keep groups somewhat balanced and to track and balance (or randomize) potential confounders.

As SPRTs are best suited for confirmatory research, preregistering the data collection plan, hypothesis, and test specifications (e.g., effect size of interest, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ levels) is strongly recommended.

Preparing an analysis script in advance enables a smooth process for continuously analyzing incoming data.
This ensures data collection stops immediately once the stopping criterion is reached, avoiding unnecessary additional data collection.

To test the analysis pipeline, use either:

- The example datasets included in the `sprtt` package
- The data generating functions, which allow specifying the true effect size for simulation testing

### 5. Collect the data and apply the SPRTs

The following test are currently implemented:

- sequential *t*-tests
- sequential one-way ANOVA with independent groups

See the vignettes for each test. *XXX*

### 5. Reporting of the results

Guidelines for the reporting of SPRTs can be found in the following paper that also explicitly covers sequential testing and specifically SPRTs [@schubert2025] <doi:10.1038/s44271-025-00356-w>.
