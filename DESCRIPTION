Description: The seq_ttest() function is the implementation of Abraham
    Waldâ€™s (1947) <doi:10.2134/agronj1947.00021962003900070011x> Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) for the test of
    a normal mean (difference) with unknown variance in R (R Core Team, 2018).
    It performs sequential t tests developed by Rushton (1950) <doi:10.2307/2332385>, Rushton (1952) <doi:10.2307/2334026> and
    Hajnal (1961) <doi:10.2307/2333131>, based on the SPRT. Specifically, seq_ttest() performs
    one-sample, two-sample, and paired t tests for testing one- and
    two-sided hypotheses.  The test is to be applied to the data during
    the sampling process, ideally after each observation. At any stage, it
    will return a decision to either continue sampling or terminate and
    accept one of the specified hypotheses. For more information on the
    SPRT t test, see Schnuerch & Erdfelder (2019) <doi:10.1037/met0000234>.
